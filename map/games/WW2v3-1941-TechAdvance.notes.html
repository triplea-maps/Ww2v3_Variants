<i>The advance of a Russian army is something that Westerners can't imagine. Behind the tank spearheads rolls on a vast horde, largely mounted on horses. The soldier carries a sack on his back, with dry crusts of bread and raw vegetables collected on the march from the fields and villages. The horses eat the straw from the house roofs - they get very little else. The Russians are accustomed to carry on for as long as three weeks in this primitive way, when advancing. You can't stop them, like an ordinary army, by cutting their communications, for you rarely find any supply columns to strike. -Hasso von Manteuffel</i><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the main players start the game with one or two active technologies and 6 free tech tokens, to roll on round 1. During the course of the game, additional free tech tokens are received and rolled, representing the technological development inherent in the system. The new tech chart offers 4 categories with 3 technologies each. Newly developed technologies activate during placement. The Heavy Bombers technological advancement is restricted to bombing raids only, for 2 dice damage per bomber.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the default changes are options enabled as default: you can customise this game back to standard WWIIv3 rules and add whatever of the options you wish, on top of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Move-Buy-Move Phase Order:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can Combat Move both before and after Purchase (you have 2 Combat Move phases; one before and one after the Purchase phase), using your normal total movement abilities in either (no additional movement, nor any actual rules changes), yet:<br>
- you must not capture enemy capitals before Purchase (it may happen only if the capital is left defenceless);<br>
- you must not repair newly conquered factories (it may happen only if the factory is left defenceless);<br>
- moves validated by Purchase choices (landing on new carriers) can be made only after Purchase<!--;<br>
- Rockets_Advance fire only at the end of the Combat Move phase after Purchase (right before Combat)-->.<br><!--
(if you want to play the game by the regular phase order, just always skip the first Combat Move phase of each turn or put "Skip Combat Move Before Purchase" on)<br>-->
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans and Chinese mixed turn plays as per correct original rules, but with the limit that Americans always go before for Combat and go after thereafter.<!--Chinese Combat Move and Combat (chained) phases happen immediately after the same Americans ones, while Chinese Non Combat Move and Place (not chained) phases happen immediately before the same Americans ones (as per correct original rules; except that you can't choose whether to go with Chinese before Americans, or vice versa).--><br>
<br>
<br>
Additional Options Turned On Default:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cat 4 + Tech Advantages + Tech Free Round 1 + Tech Free Round X + Tech Activation Delayed Before Placement + Heavy Bombers Bonus For Bombing Raids Only</b><br>
<br>
Standard Options Turned Off Default:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>LHTR Heavy Bombers</b><br>
<br>
-to play the regular WWIIv3, with Objectives and Tech, disable all the aforementioned options but enable "LHTR Heavy Bombers"-<br>
(enable "Skip Combat Move Before Purchase" to have the regular phase order)<br>
<br>
-to play Random Free Tech style, disable "Cat 4" and "Tech Advantages"-<br>
<br>
<br>
Default Enabled Additional Options<br>
<br>
<b>Cat 4</b>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You choose the tech category amongst the following 4 categories (they are just the original categories split in half):<br>
<br>
1-AIR TECH<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AA Radar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jet Power<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy Bombers<br>
<br>
2-NAVAL TECH<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improved Shipyards<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Super Subs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Range Aircrafts<br>
<br>
3-LAND TECH<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mechanized Infantry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paratroopers Advance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improved Artillery Support<br>
<br>
4-PRODUCTION TECH<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased Factory Production<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rockets Advance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War Bonds<br><!--
<br>
You get the tech by original rules, except that, being 3 techs per category, each tech starts with a 1/3 probability to be got, upon choosing the respective category.<br> -->
<br>
<b>Tech Advantages</b>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every power has one or more techs, already active start game; by power:<br>
Germans:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Paratroopers Advance";<br>
Japanese:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Super Subs";<br>
Italians:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Improved Shipyards";<br>
Americans:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Improved Shipyards",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Increased Factory Production";<br>
British:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"AA Radar",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Improved Shipyards";<br>
Russians:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mechanized Infantry",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Increased Factory Production".<br>
<br>
<b>Tech Free Round 1</b>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every power (except China) has 6 tokens at start game (it will roll on round 1) (it is supposed they were received on round 0).<br>
<br>
<b>Tech Free Round X</b>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every power (except China) receives 6 free tokens at end turn of every X rounds (it will roll the following round), recurring since round -1 or since the last round new free tokens were received (since round 0, at start game, when "Tech Free Round 1" is enabled), where X is equal to, by power:<br>
Germans 4;	Japanese 5;	Italians 6;<br>
Americans 3;	British 5;	Russians 6.<br>
(you still receive the free tokens even if you don't control your capital, but you can't use them until you do (however, whatever tokens you received before losing your capital are lost (not captured)))<br><!--
<br>
Specifically:<br>
Americans would roll 6 new additional free tokens on turns 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.<br>
Germans on 4, 8, 12, 16, etc.<br>
British and Japanese on 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.<br>
Russians and Italians on 6, 12, 18, 24, etc.<br>-->
<br>
Specifically, <span style='text-decoration: underline'>when both "Tech Free Round 1" and "Tech Free Round X" are enabled:<br>
Americans would roll 6 new additional free tokens on turns 1, 4, 7, 10, etc.<br>
Germans on 1, 5, 9, 13, etc.<br>
British and Japanese on 1, 6, 11, 16, etc.<br>
Russians and Italians on 1, 7, 13, 19, etc.</span><br>
(if "Tech Free Round X" is enabled, but not "Tech Free Round 1", there are no free rolls on round 1 and all the others, as above, happen 1 round earlier)<br><!--
<br>
(as normal, whenever you gain a tech, all tokens are discarded; so, with Low Luck, buying tokens on the same turn of the Free Tech one, or anyway buying so many tokens to end up with more than 6 total, is a waste)<br>-->
<br>
<b>Tech Activation Delayed Before Placement</b>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your tech development becomes effective during the Place Units phase<!-- of your turn (eventually, ignore the warning about too many units being purchased, if you developed Increased Factory Production, since you'll have the additional placement active on the same turn)--> (though the rolls happen at the beginning of the turn).<br>
<br>
(practically, War Bonds is effective on the same turn, Increased Factory Production is effective on the same turn for placement, but not for repair, while everything else is effective since end turn)<br>
<br>
<b>Heavy Bombers Bonus For Bombing Raids Only</b>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy Bombers roll 2 dice in bombing raids only (only 1 dice in attack).<br>
<br>
<br>
Main Options<br>
<br>
Raids May Be Preceeded By Air Battles:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Works by original rules (fighter intercepts at 2 and escorts at 1 (at 2 with Jet Power); bomber is inoffensive and can't intercept but can be taken as casualty normally and can also bomb with no escort).<br>
<br>
Canal Turkey:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sea units may move into or out of 16 Sea Zone.<br>
<br>
<br>
Other Options<br>
<br>
Cat 12:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You choose the tech category amongst the 4 aforementioned "Cat 4" categories plus the following 8 additional ones, for total 12 categories:<br>
<br>
5-FUEL TECH<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mechanized Infantry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy Bombers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improved Shipyards<br>
<br>
6-SPACE TECH<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paratroopers Advance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy Bombers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rockets Advance<br>
<br>
12-LOGISTIC TECH<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mechanized Infantry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased Factory Production<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Range Aircrafts<br>
<br>
Selectable Tech:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You pick the tech.<br>
<br>
Tech Free Tokens 1:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You receive, from any Tech Free options, only 1 token, each time (instead of 6).<br><!--
<br>
Super Sub Defence (set "Super Sub Defence Bonus" to 2):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submarines attack and defend at 3, with the "Super Subs" tech.<br>
(this option makes the categories averagely more balanced, enhancing variety)<br>-->
<br>
LHTR Heavy Bombers:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick the best 1 of 2 dice for each bomber (instead of using both).<br>
<br>
Give Initial Objectives Bonuses:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers start the game having the income from the National Objectives.<br>
(+5 PUs Germans, +5 PUs Russians, +5 PUs Japanese, +5 PUs British, +5 PUs Italians, +15 PUs Americans)<br><!-- 
<br>
Canal Northwestern Europe and Norway (not supported: you must autolimit yourselves):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can go to and from 5 Sea Zone and 6 Sea Zone only if you own at least one of Northwestern Europe or Norway at the beginning of your turn.<br>
<br>
Remove All Tech Tokens At End Of Turn:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You roll tech tokens only one time (the tokens you roll are always removed after rolling) (Low Luck Free Tech is unaffected by this option, since you automatically get one tech).<br>
<br>
<br>
General Notes<br>
<br>
All Game Options, except "Tech Advantages", can be switched on or off during the game, but some of them will have effect (via triggers) depending on the setting at start turn, of the current turn (before the Research Technology phase); not the current ones. "Tech Advantages" takes effect only once at start game (before the Research Technology of the first Germans turn). Anyway, you are not supposed to change any settings mid game.<br>
The options changing the tech categories have the following hierarchy (dominant first): "Selectable Tech", "Cat 12", "Cat 4". Anyway, you are not supposed to have more than one of them checked.<br>
<br>
<br>
Highlights<br>
<br>
Low Luck "Random Free Tech" is the same as Zlefin's "Free Tech", except that the waiting turns, to get an extra Tech, are modified (balanced) this way: +1 Germans, -1 Italians, -2 Russians.<br>
Allowed "Subs Can End NonCombat Move With Enemies", as per original rules.<br> -->
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively to the suggested bids, you can put "Setup Balance" on, to have a better balanced setup (you can still bid), for default options or default options but Low Luck on.<br>
<br>
If Low Luck is off, Setup Balance adds:<br>
1 infantry Karelia S.S.R.,<br>
1 infantry Caucasus,<br>
1 infantry Egypt.<br>
<br>
If Low Luck is on, Setup Balance adds:<br>
1 infantry Karelia S.S.R.,<br>
1 artillery Caucasus,<br>
1 armour Belorussia,<br>
1 infantry Egypt.<br>
