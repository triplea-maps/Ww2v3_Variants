UK Factory
						<br>The UK begins with a Factory "held" (as a bid), and this represents the power of her colonies to provide troops.
						<br>by Veqryn
						<br>
						<br>Balancing changes:
						<br>UK Starts with a Factory and 2 Infantry as a bid.
						<br>1 Japanese Infantry moved from French-Indo-China to Kiangsu
						<br>1 UK Infantry moved back from Burma to India
						<br>1 UK Infantry moved from Trans-Jordan to Persia
						<br>1 UK Infantry moved from South Africa to Persia
						<br>-1 Infantry in Australia
						<br>The UK starts with 6 less PU (for a total of 37)
						<br>
						<br> Tech Activation happens AFTER you place your units (at the end of your turn)
						<br> China figures troops based on After their combat phase rather than before.
						<br>
						<br> Safe places to put the factory: Canada, South Africa, Australia, Persia.
						<br> Risky places to put the factory: Egypt, India
