A Mod by Cernel, based on World War II v3 1941 1.7<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can Combat Move both before and after Purchase (you have 2 Combat Move phases; one before and one after the Purchase phase), using your normal total movement abilities in either (no additional movement, nor any actual rules changes), yet:<br>
- you must not capture enemy capitals before Purchase (it may happen only if the capital is left defenceless);<br>
- you must not repair newly conquered factories (it may happen only if the factory is left defenceless);<br>
- moves validated by Purchase choices (landing on new carriers) can be made only after Purchase<!--;<br>
- Rockets_Advances fire only at the end of the Combat Move phase after Purchase (right before Combat)-->.<br><!--
(if you want to play the game by the regular phase order, just always skip the first Combat Move phase of each turn or put "Skip Combat Move Before Purchase" on)<br>-->
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans and Chinese mixed turn plays as per correct original rules, but with the limit that Americans always go before for Combat and go after thereafter.<!--Chinese Combat Move and Combat (chained) phases happen immediately after the same Americans ones, while Chinese Non Combat Move and Place (not chained) phases happen immediately before the same Americans ones (as per correct original rules; except that you can't choose whether to go with Chinese before Americans, or vice versa).--><br>

						<b>Technology</b><br>
         				*** Air/Naval Tech ***<br>
        				SUPER SUBS- submarines attack at 3<br>
        				JET POWER- fighters attack at 4<br>
        				IMPROVED SHIPYARDS- submarine, transport and destroyer costs reduced by 1; cruiser cost reduced by 2; carrier and battleship costs reduced by 3<br>
        				AA RADAR- AA guns hit on 2 or less<br>
        				LONG RANGE AIRCRAFT- aircrafts range increased by 2<br>
        				HEAVY BOMBER- roll 2 dice for each bomber in attack, but use only the lowest one, and 2 dice for each bomber in bombing raids, but use only the highest one<br>
        				<br>
         				*** Land/Production Tech ***<br>
        				IMPROVED ARTILLERY SUPPORT- artillery support 2 infantry<br>
        				ROCKETS ADVANCE- AA guns conduct rockets attacks, with a range of 3, for 1d6 damage to production (each factory may only be targeted once per turn, and only 1 AA gun in each territory may fire) (AA guns conducting rockets attacks can't move)<br>
        				PARATROOPERS- bombers may carry 1 infantry each into hostile land territories only (both units must begin their movement in the same territory; the bomber can't make a bombing raid; the bomber must stop its Combat Move movement in the first land territory it enters that was enemy owned at start turn; if the attacked territory has only AA guns and no other defending units, the AA guns are automatically captured without firing; if the bomber is hit by AA guns, the infantry it carries is also destroyed; paratroopers alone have no way to retreat; if retreat is possible, paratroopers retreat together with all other retreating land units)<br>
        				INCREASED FACTORY PRODUCTION- factories produce 2 additional units, if territory value is 3 or greater; repair 1/2 price, rounded up<br>
        				WAR BONDS- collect 1d6 extra PUs each turn<br>
        				MECHANIZED INFANTRY- armours may carry 1 infantry each<br>
